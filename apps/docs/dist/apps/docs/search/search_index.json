The Design Process (AKA the RFC Lifecycle) In order to ensure that Arbor is a well designed, we follow an RFC process similar to Rust. If you have an idea to improve the design of Arbor, open a new discussion in our github discussions page in the relevant RFC category. Apply a label of Proposal . Feel free to link, open a PR, or add any other reference material that you believe would make your RFC likely to be accepted. RFCs are not needed for general bug fixes, refactors, documentation clean up, etc. Once your RFC is proposed, the community and maintainers can comment on the RFC. After a period of time, which will be determined by the impact of the proposal, we will move the RFC into a final comment period with the inclination: accept, close, or postpone. After the final comment period, we will make the decision on if to accept or reject the proposal.","title":"ArborLang Design"},{"location":"design/#arborlang-design","text":"This directory contains the design documents of the arbor language, runtime, and compiler.
